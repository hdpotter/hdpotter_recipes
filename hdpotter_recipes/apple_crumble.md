# Apple Crumble

Apple pie with topping in the Dutch style and no crust, the way God intended.  Makes a whole lot of crumble; consider cutting in half, using a very large container to mix filling, or making in batches.

## Ingredients
### Filling
- 2 kg granny smith apples, cored and sliced (approx. 10 large apples)
- 4 Tbsp lemon juice
- 1+1/2 cup sugar (149g)
- 4 Tbsp flour (28g)
- 4 Tbsp cornstarch (28g)
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2+1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp nutmeg
- 1/2 cup boiled cider or apple juice concentrate
- 4 tsp vanilla extract
- 4 tbsp butter, diced (56g)

## Topping
- 2 cups flour (240g)
- 1 cup white or brown sugar (184g)
- 1-2 tsp cinnamon, optional
- 16 Tbsp cold butter, diced (226g or 2 sticks)

## Steps
1. preheat oven to 425f
2. combine topping ingredients and cut with pastry cutter until integrated but lumpy
3. combine filling ingredients, mix together, and layer in large casserole dish
4. put topping over filling in even layer across the whole top
5. bake for 20m, reduce heat to 350f, bake for 40m longer or until apples are fully soft; check sooner and remove early if topping starts to turn brown or exposed apples start to blacken
