# Blueberry Pie

The blueberries are never cooked in this recipe.  Sometimes mixture will take a long time to boil and thicken; you can risk turning the heat up to medium-high if you become impatient.

## Ingredients
- 144g sugar (3/4 cup)
- 3 tbsp cornstarch
- 1/8 tsp salt
- 1 cup water
- 1 tbsp butter
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 4 cups blueberries
- 1 [[pie_crust]]

## Steps
1. combine sugar, cornstarch, salt, water
2. cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture boils
3. mixture will thicken and turn translucent; remove from heat and add butter and lemon juice, stirring to melt butter and combine
4. allow to cool, combine with blueberries, and put into pre-baked pie crust
