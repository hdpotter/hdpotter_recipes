# Pie Crust

Mother recommends waiting to put the filling into the shell until you're ready to serve.

## Ingredients
- 1 cup flour
- 1/8 tsp salt
- 6 tbsp cold butter, cut into small pieces
- 1 egg yolk
- 2 tsp water

## Steps
1. mix flour and salt
2. cut in butter with a pastry cutter until all butter chunks are very small
3. mix egg yolk with 2 tsp water, then add to flour mixture
4. mix until thoroughly combined, then wrap in wax paper or plastic and refrigerate at least 20 minutes
5. remove wrapping and roll out on the counter
6. place into pie pan, removing excess and using it to patch up gaps
7. if pie is to be baked with filling, skip this step; otherwise, prick surface all over with a fork and bake at 425f for 12 minutes or until browned
